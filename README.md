# LEGEND SUBDOMAIN FINDER
This tool is specifically designed to identify and enumerate the subdomains associated with a given website. By providing a valid link or domain name, the tool systematically analyzes the target and generates a comprehensive list of accessible subdomains. This functionality is particularly useful for security assessments, penetration testing, and general reconnaissance, as it enables users to gain deeper insights into the structure and potential entry points of a web application or online service.
